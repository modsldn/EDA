Scale and add these two vectors. 

Vector A is [2,1] and needs to be scaled by a factor of 3. 

Vector B is [1,3] and needs to be scaled by a factor of 2. 

What is the resulting vector when you scale and add these
two vectors together? 

Complete the code below, then execute the script by 
typing this command in the terminal:
